# Personal-Dataset-Project-
## Introduction 
For my personal dataset project, I decided to explore if there was a link between the size of the sample of ED (Emergency Department) visits due to asthma and a metric that was derived by combining the percentage of visits with their standard error across different states in the United States.
## Data Processing 
The basis for the data cleaning process was pretty solid because the primary numbers, which were obtained from a credible organization such as the CDC, were very accurate and statistically valid. On the other hand, the presentation of the data was the biggest problem: it was not very readable and could not be directly used in a program like Excel, which meant that a lot of manual work had to be done to change the variables and make sure they were structurally compatible.
## Exploratory Analysis
Investigating data through the scatterplot, revealing the weak negative correlation between sample size and the combined asthma visit percentage plus standard error, was the first step in exploratory analysis.
